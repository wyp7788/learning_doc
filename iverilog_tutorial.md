# Iverilog Simulator

The `iverilog` and `vvp` commands are the most important commands available to users of Icarus Verilog. **The "iverilog" command is the compiler, and the "vvp" command is the simulation runtime engine.** What sort of output the compiler actually creates is controlled by command line switches, but normally it produces output in the default vvp format, which is in turn executed by the vvp program.
